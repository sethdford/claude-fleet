## Brand Voice

### Tone Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Technical** | Precise, accurate, developer-native | "Spawn workers with isolated git worktrees" |
| **Confident** | Assured but not arrogant | "Fleet handles the complexity" |
| **Efficient** | Concise, no fluff | "One command. Multiple agents. Parallel progress." |
| **Approachable** | Not intimidating | "Your first swarm in 60 seconds" |

### Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use technical terms accurately
- Lead with benefits, follow with features
- Show, don't tell (code examples > descriptions)
- Acknowledge complexity, then simplify it

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords without substance
- Over-promise capabilities
- Ignore error cases or limitations
- Talk down to developers

### Sample Copy

**Hero Statement:**
```
Stop waiting. Start orchestrating.

Claude Fleet transforms Claude Code into a coordinated
development team—spawning specialized agents that work
in parallel, checkpoint their progress, and collaborate
through structured communication.

One lead. Multiple workers. Unlimited potential.
```

**Feature Description:**
```
Workflow Engine

Define your development process as a DAG. Fleet executes
steps in optimal order, respects dependencies, and handles
failures gracefully. From feature branches to production
deploys—codified and repeatable.

```
Concept: Conductor's baton or signal wave
Visual: Flowing lines emanating from central point
Meaning: Control and coordination
```

**Icon/Favicon: The Node**
```
Concept: Single agent node
Visual: Circle with internal detail (eye, pulse, or connection points)
Meaning: Individual agent, part of larger system
```

### Visual Motifs

1. **Grid Patterns**: Subtle dot grids representing coordination
2. **Connection Lines**: Flowing lines between elements
3. **Gradient Glows**: Soft glows on active elements

## Messaging Framework

### Core Messages by Feature

| Feature | Headline | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Agent** | "One Lead, Many Workers" | Spawn specialized agents for parallel development |
| **Workflows** | "Codify Your Process" | DAG-based workflows with automatic dependency resolution |
| **Checkpoints** | "Progress, Preserved" | Structured progress reports with acceptance gates |
| **Blackboard** | "Swarm Intelligence" | Agents communicate through shared message boards |
| **Worktrees** | "Isolated by Design" | Each agent works in its own git branch |
| **TLDR Cache** | "Context Without Cost" | Token-efficient code understanding |

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Single Claude Sessions:**
> "Move from conversations to orchestration. Fleet lets you run multiple Claude agents in parallel, each with persistent state and isolated workspaces."

**vs. Other Multi-Agent Frameworks:**
> "Built specifically for Claude Code. Native integration, purpose-built workflows, and developer-first design."

**vs. Manual Coordination:**
> "Stop copy-pasting between sessions. Fleet handles agent lifecycle, communication, and state management automatically."
